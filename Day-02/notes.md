# Day 02 – Internship Learning (Python Basics)

## What I Learned
- Basics of Data Analysis and Data Science
- Difference between Data Analyst and Data Scientist
- Python basics for data analysis
- Variables, data types, and operators in Python
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
- Python data structures
- Implemented a simple calculator using Python

---

## Data Analysis vs Data Science

### Data Analysis
- Studying data to find useful information and answers
- Helps in decision making
- Involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing data, and creating reports

Tools used:
- Excel
- SQL
- Python
- Power BI / Tableau

Example:
- Finding which product sells the most
- Finding which day sales are highest

### Data Science
- Uses data along with programming and mathematics
- Focuses on prediction and future outcomes
- Involves machine learning and model building

Example:
- Movie recommendations
- Predicting exam scores

---

## Python Basics
- Python is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language
- Widely used in Data Analysis and Data Science

Example:
print("Hello World")

---

## Variables
- Variables are used to store data

Example:
x = 10  
name = "Jay"

---

## Python Data Types
- int (integer)
- float (decimal)
- string (text)
- boolean (True / False)

Example:
age = 21  
price = 99.5  
course = "AI"  
is_student = True  

---

## Operators in Python

### Arithmetic Operators
- +  (Addition)
- -  (Subtraction)
- *  (Multiplication)
- /  (Division)

### Comparison Operators
- >
- <
- ==

### Logical Operators
- and
- or

---

## Jupyter Notebook
- Used to write and run Python code step-by-step
- Shows output immediately
- Best suited for data analysis tasks

---

## Python Data Structures

### List
- Stores multiple values
- Ordered and changeable

### Tuple
- Similar to list but cannot be modified
- Immutable

### Set
- Stores only unique values
- No duplicate elements

### Dictionary
- Stores data in key-value pairs
- Used to represent structured data

---

## Task Given
- Create a simple calculator using Python

## Task Description
- Take two numbers as input from the user
- Ask the user to choose an operation
- Perform the selected operation
- Display the result

## Learning from Task
- Practiced variables and data types
- Used input() and print()
- Applied conditional statements

---

## Issue Faced
- I already knew that the GitHub repository URL should be used with the `git clone` command, but in a hurry 😅 I directly pasted the URL into the terminal.

## Solution
- Took a quick pause 😄, realized the mistake, and used the `git clone` command correctly.

---

## Key Takeaway
- Python basics and data structures form the foundation for data analysis, and practicing small tasks helps in understanding concepts better.
